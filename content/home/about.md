# About Us
The Tech Titans are
an ethnically diverse group
of five 9th grade girls
participating in the First
Tech Challenge (FTC)
competitions. We are
based in Johns Creek,
Georgia. Our talented team
can program in JAVA,
design, and print parts in
3D CAD, as well as design and build the robot. We built an 18 inch by 18
inch robot that is able to run autonomously and run through teleop, as well
as write a business plan, maintained an Engineering Notebook, mentored a
First Lego League (FLL) team and learned about budgeting.
