## About Us ​ 

The Tech Titans are
an ethnically diverse group
of five 9th grade girls
participating in the First
Tech Challenge (FTC)
competitions. We are
based in Johns Creek,
Georgia. Our talented team
can program in JAVA,
design, and print parts in
3D CAD, as well as design and build the robot. We built an 18 inch by 18
inch robot that is able to run autonomously and run through teleop, as well
as write a business plan, maintained an Engineering Notebook, mentored a
First Lego League (FLL) team and learned about budgeting.



## History

We are a group of 5 ninth grade girls going to two different schools. We
meet in the coaches basement. We started FLL in fifth grade. This is our
second year of doing FTC. After winning third place in state, we decided we
wanted to challenge ourselves more. The highest we have gotten in the
couple of years that we have been a group with FIRST is states. Our first
season of FTC we have got all the way to states, placing 7th in the state of
Georgia last year. We had a great time competing with the best teams in
Georgia.
