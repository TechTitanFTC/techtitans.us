## Overall
- We hope to get some awards including, Rockwell Collins, and the design
award!
- In the beginning, when we created our goals, we hoped to update the
engineering notebook in OneNote every meeting.
- Plan for robot to get 100% of points!
- We also hope this year we can at least make it to states!

## Outreach:
- Last year, we started to judge and help around the North Georgia FLL
competition. This year, we will volunteer again at the FLL Tournament.
- Every week last season and again this season, we have helped mentor the
Findley Oaks FLL team, “Falcon Botonators”. We help with any problem
they might need including, programming, building, how to help align,
project, powerpoint help, etc...
- Use our skills to build a motor and wheelchair for a little girl, via
openwheelchair.org.

## Social Media:
- This season we hope we can increase our social media and
marketing skills. We try to post every meeting as much as we can.
