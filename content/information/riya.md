Riya is one of the main programmers of the group. She has
been in the group since the very beginning. With her keen skill
of knowing how to program from JAVA, she has applied that to
our robot, “Tyson”. Balancing Schoolwork and Clubs, she
always finds time to make sure she does her robotics. When
Riya gets older she would like to be in the Medical Profession.
