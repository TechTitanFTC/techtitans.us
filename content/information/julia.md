Julia is in Beta Club, 121 Reach, and Band. While doing
all of those things, she comes every Sunday and Tuesdays
for our meetings. Julia is the main 3D Cad designer. She
wants to learn 3D design and wants to go in to some career
that involves a little bit of graphic design. Julia is very
hardworking and always available to help around the team.
Julia is very ambitious about this robotics team.
